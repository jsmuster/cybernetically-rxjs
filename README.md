# cybernetically-rxjs
Cybernetically RxJS ES6 implementation.

This library includes few major creator operator functions, pipeable operators, and Subjects.

I plan to update it soon and convert it for use in Typescript. My aim is to replicate the RxJS functionality to facilitate a seamless transition while retaining all features. I will reduce the code even further and then minify it to achieve the smallest footprint.
